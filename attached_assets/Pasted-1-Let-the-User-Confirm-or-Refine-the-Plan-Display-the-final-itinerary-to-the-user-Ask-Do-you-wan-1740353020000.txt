1. Let the User Confirm or Refine the Plan
Display the final itinerary to the user.
Ask: “Do you want to make changes or is this good to go?”
If they want changes:
The user might type: “Add an extra day in Kyoto,” or “Switch Day 2’s activities.”
Re-run your AI with the new constraints.
If they confirm the itinerary:
Let them select it or press an “Add to Calendar” button.
Practical Implementation
Front-end: After receiving the AI’s itinerary text, store it in the browser or your back-end session.
UI: Possibly show a “Confirm Plan” or “Refine Plan” button.
2. Parse the Confirmed Itinerary
Before creating calendar events, you need each day, activity time, description, and duration in a structured format.

Use your calendar_service.parse_itinerary(content) method. It looks for lines like:

markdown
Copy
Edit
## Day 3: Tokyo Heritage
- 09:00 Visit Asakusa (2 hours)
…and extracts a list of “days,” each with “activities.”

Store or keep that parsed data in memory until the user clicks “Add to Calendar.”

Practical Implementation
In your front-end, once the user selects an itinerary, do a POST to /api/itinerary/parse (or some route).
The back-end calls calendar_service.parse_itinerary(itinerary_text) and returns a JSON array of day-by-day activities.
Or, you can skip a separate parse route and do it directly in the “create calendar events” route.
3. Add to Google Calendar
After parsing:

Check if the user is authenticated with Google Calendar.
If not, redirect them to your OAuth flow (/api/calendar/auth).
Create events via calendar_service.create_calendar_events(...).
In your code, you pass the user’s itinerary text (the same that was parsed).
Optionally, you also let the user specify start date or time zone.
Flow:

User clicks “Add to Calendar.”
Front-end calls something like:
javascript
Copy
Edit
fetch('/api/calendar/event', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    itinerary_content: selectedItineraryText,
    start_date: "2025-03-10"
  })
});
The back-end calls:
python
Copy
Edit
# routes.py
if 'google_credentials' not in session:
    return redirect("/api/calendar/auth")

calendar_service.create_calendar_events(
    session['google_credentials'],
    itinerary_content,
    start_date
)
4. Store the Final Itinerary (Optional)
If you want the user to be able to come back and edit or retrieve the plan:

Save the final itinerary text in:
Airtable (airtable_service.py), or
Local JSON (like in storage_service.py).
Keep a reference like record_id or file_path to recall it later if the user logs in or revisits.
5. Additional Considerations
Time Zone: Right now, your create_calendar_events uses timeZone: "UTC". If the user is traveling, you may ask them which time zone to apply (e.g., local Japan time).
Start Date Offsets: If your AI itinerary says “Day 1,” you can let the user pick the real start date in the UI. Then calendar_service offsets each day from that date.
Partial Selection: If the user only wants to add certain days or activities, you might let them check/uncheck events in a list and only sync the chosen ones.
Re-Parsing if the user edits: If your user modifies the text, you should re-parse to keep the data structure accurate before calendar creation.
Error Handling: For example, if the itinerary is missing time info or a day has no activities, your parse function might fail or skip events.
6. Code Changes / Steps to Implement
Front-end:

Add a button “Add to Calendar” next to the displayed itinerary.
On click:
Check if user is connected to Google Calendar (i.e., has credentials).
If not, show a “Connect Google Calendar” prompt or automatically redirect.
Back-end (routes.py or similar):

A route to create the calendar events, e.g. @app.route('/api/calendar/event', methods=['POST']).
In that route:
Validate the user is logged in or you have their Google OAuth tokens in session['google_credentials'].
Call calendar_service.create_calendar_events(...) with the user’s itinerary text plus an optional start_date.
calendar_service.py:

Already has parse_itinerary and create_calendar_events.
Possibly ask for the user’s time zone (or default to “Asia/Tokyo” for a Japan trip).
Airtable or storage_service (optional):

If you want to store the final itinerary, call something like airtable_service.save_itinerary(user_id, itinerary_text) or store in JSON.
7. Putting It All Together
User sees AI’s recommended itinerary.
User decides to confirm or request refinements.
If confirmed:
The itinerary text is stored or just saved in session.
Add to Calendar button → calls back-end → checks user’s Google auth → parses itinerary → create_calendar_events.
Optionally, the system stores the final itinerary in Airtable/local JSON so the user can retrieve or edit it later.
With these steps and minor code additions, your AI can seamlessly move from “here’s the itinerary” to “let’s sync it with your personal calendar.”
